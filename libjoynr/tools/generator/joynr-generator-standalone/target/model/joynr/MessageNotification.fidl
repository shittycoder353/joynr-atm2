			receives a message for a known recipient, but cannot deliver it
			to the recipient due to not being able to create a messaging stub.
			The interface provider offers a participant ID filter as well as
			a message type filter for this selective broadcast.

			message matches the specified participant ID or does no filtering if this
			parameter is not set.
			The message type filter filters events based on whether the type of the queued
			message matches the specified message type or does no filtering if this
			parameter is not set.

			is used by the recipient filter and defines
